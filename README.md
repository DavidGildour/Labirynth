Labirynth ver. 2.1
A simple, yet fun game where your goal is to exit the maze you're trapped in!
The mazes created by this program are randomly generated through depth-first recursive backtracking
algorithm as described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Depth-first_search
Implementation idea borrowed from Daniel Shiffman of Coding Train: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4

From main menu you can access OPTIONS menu, where you can change your control settings
and size of the maze. The default settings are:
size - 5,
up - 'u',
down - 'd',
left - 'l',
right - 'r'.
To exit the game type 'quit' or choose '4' in the main menu. If you are struggling to solve the maze you can
type 'solve' during the game to show the solution (you can't finish the game then, though!).
Press ENTER to continue.
